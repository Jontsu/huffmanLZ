Datastructures and Algorithms project. Current implementation works with text strings.

## Running the program

This is optional, but it is a good idea to create a virtual environment prior to installing dependencies or running the application, so execute the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

To install the necessary dependencies and start the development server, execute the following commands in your terminal. Make sure you are in the root directory of the application:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
