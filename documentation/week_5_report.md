This week I planned on refactoring my code and ensuring a better test coverage. However, after a very useful feedback comment I decided to focus on fixing my solution to handle the bits and bytes correctly. Ultimately, a very simple solution that works perfectly. Now both algorithms behave as expected without integrity issues.

This week I also undertook the first code review and to my delight got some really useful comments from realtalin code review on how to implement the tests and notes on my code readability giving pointers for my refactoring effort. Next week I will spend time on both of these tasks to try and finalise my solution.

## Hours: 7 (excluding code review)
