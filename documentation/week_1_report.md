# Week 1

I reviewed the topic choices and decided on compression. After that, I set up the repo and undertook the tasks instructed in the course materials, as well as familiarised myself with the chosen algorithms. 

Next week I aim to create the project structure and write an initial implementation of the Huffman compression algorithm.
