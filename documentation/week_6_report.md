This week I started by changing the implementation to handle larger files than those that can be saved into session. This is done by saving the uploaded and compressed files into assets folder. Refactored LZW based on code review suggestions. Started to write more unit tests, but test coverage is still substandard.

Next week need to update LZW commentary and increase the test coverage. Otherwise I believe the implementation is working now as intended and is following so called "clean code" standards.

Need to also update the readme to include instructions on how to run the tests sperately.
