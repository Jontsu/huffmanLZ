# Huffman and Lempel-Ziv

## Project Description
- This project is an implementation and comparison of Huffman and LZW compression algorithms
- Inputs are text or data files and outputs are their compressed versions
- Aim is to achieve compression rates of at least 40% to 60%
- Project is written in Python and the project language is English

## Overview of the selected algorithms
- Both are lossless compression techniques
- Huffman compresses data by assigning prefix codes to frequently used characters based on their occurrence using a binary tree
- Huffman time complexity is O(n log n) with its basic implementation and needs memory to store a tree structure that grows linearly with the size of the input
- Lempel-Ziv compresses data by referencing earlier sequences and building a dictionary that captures recurring patterns in the input, particular version of the Lempel-Ziv used is LZW. LZW replaces repeating sequences with a single code that references the dictionary.
- LZW time complexity is linear or slighly more and needs memory to store a dictionary that generally grows linearly with the size of the input until the dictionary is full
