To finalise the project I wrote tests to achieve 100% test and branch coverage, refactored the overall code somewhat and enhanced the commentary. I also wrote all the required documentation for final submissions and ran performance tests to review the compression efficiency with varying size inputs. 

I used chat.openai.com to help debug some persistent issues when converting my lzw to allow for varying dictionary sizes (my intial approach to convert the lzw was overly complicated resulting into random integrity issues with some dictionary sizes. Ultimately, I had to start fresh and let go of the initial solution).
